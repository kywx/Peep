# Peep
Peep posts a cat image on twitter. That's it.

## Installation
First, install tweepy using the package manager pip to get easy access the twitter api endpoints.

It's not necessary, but you can also install python-dotenv to keep your tokens handy in a .env file and away from the actual python file. Just replace the variables in the .py file if you don't care for it.

```bash
pip install tweepy
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install python-dotenv
```
